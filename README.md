# Lead Generation and Conversion Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains the work for a lead generation and conversion analysis assignment aimed at identifying insights into lead demographics, sourcing efficiency, and program interest trends for an e-learning platform. 

### Key Highlights:
- Generated and analyzed a dataset with **10,000 synthetic leads**.
- Explored trends in demographics, programs, and lead sources.
- Performed conversion rate analysis and suggested a **budget allocation strategy** for marketing optimization.
- Summarized findings and actionable recommendations in a structured **Summary Report**.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis was generated using Python's `Faker` and `Numpy` libraries. It includes the following features:

- **Lead ID**: Unique identifier for each lead.
- **Location**: City or region of the lead.
- **College**: College/University of the lead.
- **Year of Study**: Current academic year (e.g., 1st, 2nd, etc.).
- **Program Interest**: E-learning program interest (e.g., AI, Robotics, etc.).
- **Lead Source**: Platform or channel through which the lead was acquired.
- **Converted**: Whether the lead converted into a customer (`Yes`/`No`).

The dataset can be found in the repository as `Lead_Info_Converted.csv`.
## Methodology
The analysis was conducted in a Jupyter Notebook (`Assignment.ipynb`) using Python. Below are the key steps:

1. **Data Preparation**:
    - Generated the dataset with realistic distributions.
    - Cleaned and preprocessed the data for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Examined demographic trends (e.g., gender, location, year of study).
    - Analyzed program popularity and lead sourcing efficiency.

3. **Conversion Analysis**:
    - Computed overall and source-specific conversion rates.
    - Identified high-conversion programs and demographic patterns.

4. **Budget Allocation**:
    - Designed a budget allocation strategy based on conversion rates and source contributions.
    - Demonstrated allocation using a hypothetical marketing budget of â‚¹100,000.

5. **Recommendations**:
    - Provided targeted strategies for improving program reach and lead conversion rates.
## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas, Numpy**: Data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Faker**: Dataset generation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment.
